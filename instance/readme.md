# ----- DIRECTORY DEFINITION -----

- SQLite database will be created in this file.
- The app looks for a .env config file as detailed below
- Note: Define any global app settings as a FLASK_YOUR_SETTING = 'setting'

.env Example
---
```
FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='sqlite:///test.db'   # on first run, test.db file will be created in this folder.
FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS=False          # removes deprecated error messaging from Flask
FLASK_SECRET_KEY = ''                               # generated by app if not present on first run
FLASK_ENCRYPTION_KEY = ''                           # generated by app if not present on first run
FLASK_YOUR_SETTING = 'setting'                      # will be added to the app.config file
```

- Settings can be referenced in any route using the: `current_app.config['YOUR_SETTING']` dict call
- These settings will only load when the app is started. If any changes are made to the .env while the app is running they need to also be added to the app.config to be referenced in the app.
